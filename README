PURPOSE

Litany is a simple class that does reads Microsoft CSV formatted
converting them into an iterator of lists of strings. It also has a
static method to create a line from a list of strings.

MOTIVATION

Litany is the smallest useful project that I've created. As such, I use
it as a model for project organization. Because the code base is so
small, I can focus on the most complete user support and documentation.
